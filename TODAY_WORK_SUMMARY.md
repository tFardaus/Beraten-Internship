# Today's Work Summary (6 Lines)

1. **Price Sorting Feature**: Implemented price sorting filter on Books Index page with dropdown options (Low to High, High to Low) using LINQ OrderBy/OrderByDescending, allowing users to sort books by price while preserving search functionality.

2. **ViewComponent Implementation**: Converted inline price sorting form into reusable PriceSortFilterViewComponent with dedicated view (Default.cshtml), demonstrating component-based architecture for better code reusability and maintainability across multiple pages.

3. **Session Management - Theory**: Learned ASP.NET Core Session concept including server-side storage, session ID cookies, idle timeout mechanism, and differences between session and cookies for maintaining user-specific data across HTTP requests.

4. **Session Implementation - Shopping Cart**: Implemented complete shopping cart functionality using Session storage including session configuration in Program.cs (30-minute timeout), SessionExtensions helper methods for JSON serialization, and CartItem model for temporary data storage.

5. **Shopping Cart Features**: Created Add to Cart functionality on Books Index page, Cart page displaying all items with quantity and total calculation, Remove/Clear cart operations, and cart count badge in navigation bar showing real-time item count.

6. **Session Lifecycle Understanding**: Analyzed five session termination scenarios (idle timeout after 30 minutes, explicit clear, browser close, server restart, user logout) and explored production considerations including persistent storage options (Redis, SQL Server) for high-availability applications.
